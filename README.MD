# RATPOISON SCRIPTS

This is my collection of bash scripts I use with my window manager ratpoison.
My ratpoisonrc calls the ratpoisonInit.sh.
This emulates a highly configurable status bar.
Almost all scripts are using xecho to display Text in own windows.
To wait for window creation and then move to the next window, xwait is used.
For xecho see [1], for xwait [2].
Thanks for the creation of this wonderful software.

Other software:
* acpi
* rfkill
* light [3]
